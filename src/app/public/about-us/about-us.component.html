        <h2>Our History: A Century of Growth</h2>
        <p>Founded in 1892 by philanthropist Thomas W. Ellington, TomCollege began as a small liberal arts seminary dedicated to serving the region. Over the last century, we have expanded into a comprehensive research university, adding acclaimed schools of engineering, business, and health sciences.</p>
        <p>Our commitment remains rooted in the belief that a strong foundation in the liberal arts, combined with cutting-edge technology and research, is the key to preparing ethical leaders for the modern world. We honor our past while constantly innovating for the future.</p>
